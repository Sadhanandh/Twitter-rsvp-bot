Directly upload images to Fb without using graph api which requires permissions.
This simulates a browser and uploads the pic to the users album.

I have implemented a bulk image uploader using the bypasser.
Check out the mob.py if you just require the bypass library.

Test the uploader by using the xml's which has the username and password defined as per the demo xml.
The location of the image file also needs to be defined in the xml
file -> caption.txt
Contains the message to post along with the image.

file -> images/settings.ini
Contains the location of the xmls and the loop frequency with which it should check the folder for a new xml file.

If everthing is good to go then -> 
python looper.py

A taskbar icon should appear.
